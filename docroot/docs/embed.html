<h2>Using Upteer with your website</h2>

<p>This is a technical document that assumes you are familiar with
HTML and CSS.  If that's not you, the short story is that any
opportunities you list on Upteer can be easily displayed on your own
website. </p>


<h4>Displaying your opportunities</h4>

<p>After you have set up your organization on Upteer, you can also
display opportunities on your own site simply by adding the following
HTML to one of your web pages: </p>

<div class="codediv"><pre>
&lt;div id="upteerdisplaydiv"&gt;12345&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src="https://www.upteer.com/js/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>Replace the <code>12345</code> in the example with the ID of your
organization.  You can get your organization ID by "right clicking"
the link to your organization from your profile.
The <code>upteerdisplay</code> div can be anywhere you want the
opportunities to be displayed, as long as it comes before the embed
script. </p>

<p>Those two lines are all you need to display your current
opportunities and allow volunteers to interact with them.  The rest of
this document is additional options if you want them. </p>


<h4>Making the opportunities display match your site</h4>

<p>By default, the opportunities displayed on your site look just like
they do on Upteer.  If you want the opportunities to match the look
and feel of your own site, you can override the default style for
everything in the display by providing your own css file: </p>

<div class="codediv"><pre>
&lt;div id="upteercssoverride"&gt;https://yoursite.org/css/upteerlookandfeel.css&lt;/div&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>Replace the CSS file URL with the complete link to the CSS file on
your site.  Upteer will include your CSS file last when it generates
the content display, so you can override anything you want.  If you
run into any difficulty customizing any display elements, let us know.
Our goal is to make this as easy as possible. </p>



<h4>Automatic login for your users</h4>

<p>If volunteers do not already sign in to your website, Upteer will
handle sign in as needed and you can just skip this section.  If you
have volunteers who sign in to your site, and you would like to
automatically log them in to Upteer to interact with your
opportunities there, add the following HTML above the embed script on
your web page: </p>

<div class="codediv"><pre>
&lt;div class="upteeruseremail"&gt;name@example.com&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="upteerusername"&gt;Profile Name&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="upteeruserpic"&gt;https://yoursite.org/pics/profpic.png&lt;/div&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>The first div is required.  The second two are optional, but Upteer
may prompt the user to complete their profile if they are not
available.  The divs can be anywhere on the page before the embed
script.  If you don't want this information to show on the page, you
can set the style of the divs to <code>display:none</code>.  Either
way, only the person logged in will see their own information. </p>

<p>For security, the page embedding your Upteer opportunities must be
on the same site as the home page for your organization as listed on
Upteer. </p>

<p>When the user interacts with Upteer through your site, Upteer first
checks to see if they have an Upteer account using their email
address.  If no account is found, then Upteer creates a profile using
the information provided and sets it to be accessible via your web
site.  If the user has a profile accessible from your site, then they
are automatically logged in and interact with the listed opportunities
the same way as if they had logged into Upteer directly.  No need to
log in a second time.  If the user already has a profile, but it is
not yet accessible from your site, then they are prompted to add
access permission for your site before continuing. </p>
