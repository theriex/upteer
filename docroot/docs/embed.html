<h2>Using Upteer with your website</h2>

<p>This is a technical document that assumes you are familiar with
HTML and CSS.  If that's not you, the short story is that any
opportunities you list on Upteer can also easily be displayed on your
own website. </p>


<h4>Displaying your opportunities</h4>

<p>To display opportunities on your own site, just add the following
HTML to one of your web pages: </p>

<div class="codediv"><pre>
&lt;div id="upteerdisplaydiv"&gt;12345&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src="https://www.upteer.com/js/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>Replace the <code>12345</code> in the example with the ID of your
organization.  You can get your organization ID by "right clicking"
the link to your organization from your profile.
The <code>upteerdisplay</code> div can be anywhere you want the
opportunities to be displayed, as long as it comes before the embed
script. </p>

<p>Those two lines are all it takes.  The rest of this document
describes additional options if you want them. </p>



<h4>Making the embedded display match your site</h4>

<p>By default, the opportunities displayed on your site look just like
they do on Upteer.  If you want the display to match the look and feel
of your own site, you can specify your own css override by adding the
following div to your html: </p>

<div class="codediv"><pre>
&lt;div id="upteercssoverride"&gt;https://yoursite.org/css/upteerlookandfeel.css&lt;/div&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>Replace the div contents with the full URL for your CSS file.
Note that because Upteer is a secure site, your css file must also be
served over https.  Upteer will include your CSS file last when it
generates the content display, so you can override anything you want.
Here's some sample override css files you can use or model: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.upteer.com/css/embed/sand.css"
       onclick="window.open('https://www.upteer.com/css/embed/sand.css');return false;">sand.css</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.upteer.com/css/embed/blue.css"
       onclick="window.open('https://www.upteer.com/css/embed/blue.css');return false;">blue.css</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you run into any difficulties customizing display elements,
let us know and we'll work with you to make things look good.</p>



<h4>Interacting with opportunities in the embedded display</h4>

<p>By default, clicking opportunity links opens them in a new Upteer
window.  If you would prefer users to interact from within your site,
then your embedding page must redirect to Upteer to verify login.
Upteer will then redirect back, passing along authentication details.
To trigger the login redirect add the following div to your html: </p>

<div class="codediv"><pre>
&lt;div id="upteerloginreturn"&gt;https://yoursite.org/upteerembed.html&lt;/div&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>Replace the div contents with the full external URL of your
embedding page.  Users landing on your page will see the same embedded
Upteer display, but if they are logged in they can interact with
opportunities directly within your page.  If they are not logged in,
then a "Sign In To Upteer" button is provided so they can do that and
return to your embed page. </p>



<h4>Using the Upteer API directly</h4>

<p>If your site requires more advanced functionality, you can access
the same REST server API that Upteer itself uses.  The API is open and
may be used to read or update any information that a user is
authorized for.  See the <code>app.yaml</code> file in the
<a href="https://github.com/theriex/upteer"
   onclick="window.open('https://github.com/theriex/upteer');return false;">Upteer GitHub project</a>
for endpoint descriptions. </p>

<p>If creating accounts, be aware that Upteer requires email address
validation, an uploaded picture, a real name, and a zipcode before a
profile may be active.  It is also normal for a profile to include
life status (student, professional, retired etc), a comment describing
interests, and primary skills for matching opportunities.  These
secondary descriptive fields change over time and are influenced by
the Upteer volunteer community. </p>

<p>Prompting for Upteer login credentials from your own site requires
permission from Upteer. </p>
