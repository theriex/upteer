We've blown our quota.

Yes, we have exceeded the allocated daily server limit and are now
done for the day.  Looks like someone needs to add to the server
budget.  Did we mention that we are actively seeking sponsors?  If
that's not you, then you'll just have to try again tomorrow.  In the
meantime, feel free to 
<a href="mailto:admin@upteer.com?subject=OverQuota">drop us a line</a>
and let us know you got this error message.  Maybe someone can spare
some change to keep the lights on a bit longer...
