Welcome to the sourcebase for The Volunteer Network.  See
http://www.upteer.com for an overview of what this is all about.

You are extremely welcome to get involved with testing, coding, QA,
graphics, docs, explanatory videos or anything else you might be able
to do.  Feel free to get in touch directly via email for general
questions or just to say hello.

Feel free to create or issues or enhancements.  If you are reporting a
bug, thank you!  Note as much detail as you can remember about what
happened and we'll get on it. 

If you want to work on fixing an issue or creating an enhancement, add
a response to the issue so you don't overlap with anyone, and can get
help if you need it.


Web application development:
---------------------------

This is a pure functional javascript web application supported by a
stateless python server.  API endpoints accept parameter info and
return a JSON array.

To contribute code (javascript, css, html - things other than graphics
or docs), you will need to develop your changes locally, then submit a
pull request to have the changes reviewed and incorporated.  If the
changes you want to make involve bringing in additional third party
technology (e.g. libraries, fonts, frameworks) it is best to clear
those ahead of time as they can negatively impact performance.
