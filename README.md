Welcome to the sourcebase for The Volunteer Network.  See
http://www.upteer.com for an overview of what this is all about.

You are very welcome to get involved with coding, QA, graphics, docs,
or whatever.  Feel free to get in touch.

For coding, this is a pure functional javascript web application
supported by a stateless python server.  API endpoints accept
parameter info and return a JSON array.
